# Gex : Graph Execution

*This library is under heavy development.*

This library provides an executable node graph system that 
may be used as a standalone software or embedded in other applications.
Nodes are defined in external libraries used as plugins, and loaded at
runtime, either using C++ or python.

It provides both C++ and python wrapper api, as well as an optional ui
module using Qt providing basic ui widgets.
